If you have implemented a plugin for another language model, please make a pull request!
I want to avoid including plugins that can be replicated using prompts and piping alone,
but core language model API clients are more than welcome. Please use the provided
`.clang-format` for formatting, and embed any dependencies in the `3rdparty/` folder.
