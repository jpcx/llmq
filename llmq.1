.SH NAME
llmq \- a query CLI and context manager for LLM-powered shell pipelines.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B llmq
[\fB\-hqiv\fR]
[\fIACTION\fR]
[\fIPLUGIN\fR][://[\fB~\fR]\fICONTEXT\fR]
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]...
[\fB--\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B llmq
is essentially a wrapper for LLM API plugins that manages command-line
arguments, context and configuration files, authentication, and I/O.
See the README to develop your own plugins.
.PP
Each plugin defines paths for configuration and conversation context storage,
which are $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/llmq/PLUGIN and $XDG_DATA_DIR/llmq/PLUGIN by default
(or ~/.config/llmq/PLUGIN and ~/.local/share/llmq/PLUGIN if XDG dirs not defined).
Directories are created if they do not exist.
.PP
llmq can also create and use temporary context files, which are stored in
/tmp/llmq/PLUGIN. Any CONTEXT argument that begins with '~' is stored
relative to the temp directory, not the data directory. Additionally,
calling init without CONTEXT will create a unique temporary file and
print its name.

.SH PLUGIN
At present, gpt is the only plugin available.

See `llmq help gpt` for more info.

.SH CONTEXT
A YAML-encoded query/chat context file (e.g. model parameters, messages).
.br
CONTEXT omits the '.yml' suffix present on all context files.
.br
If CONTEXT begins with '~', it is stored in the temp directory.

Positional plugin args. Typically messages, but depends on the plugin.
.br
If ACTION is query or chat (without -i), reads stdin into one MSG.
